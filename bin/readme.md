## Where are the new binaries?

From v0.5.0 on forward, the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/releases) system will be used for binaries.

### What binary should I choose?

You should always try to use the binaries from the release page. This directory is for legacy purposes only!

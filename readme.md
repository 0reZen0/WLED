## Welcome to my project WLED!

WLED is a fast and (relatively) secure implementation of an ESP8266 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B) LEDs!
Now also with experimental ESP32 support.

### Features: (V0.5.0)
- RGB, HSB, and brightness sliders
- Settings page - configuration over network
- Access Point and station mode - automatic failsafe AP
- WS2812FX library integrated for over 50 special effects!
- Secondary color support lets you use even more effect combinations
- Support for RGBW strips
- 25 user presets! Save your favorite colors and effects and apply them easily!
- Nightlight function (gradually dims down)
- Notifier function (multiple ESPs sync color via UDP broadcast)
- Support for power pushbutton
- Custom Theater Chase
- Full OTA software update capability (HTTP and ArduinoOTA)
- Password protected OTA page for added security (OTA lock)
- Alexa smart home device server (including dimming)
- NTP and experimental analog clock function

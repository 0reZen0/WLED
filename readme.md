## Welcome to my project WLED!

WLED is a fast and (relatively) secure implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B) LEDs!

### Features: (V0.7.0)
- RGB, HSB, and brightness sliders
- All new, mobile-friendly web UI!
- Settings page - configuration over network
- Access Point and station mode - automatic failsafe AP
- WS2812FX library integrated for over 50 special effects (+Custom Theater Chase)!
- Secondary color support lets you use even more effect combinations
- Alexa smart home device server (including dimming)
- Beta syncronization to Philips hue lights
- Support for RGBW strips
- 25 user presets! Save colors and effects and apply them easily! Supports cycling through them.
- HTTP request API for simple integration
- Macro functions to automatically execute API calls
- Nightlight function (gradually dims down)
- Notifier function (multiple ESPs sync color via UDP broadcast)
- Support for power pushbutton
- Support for the Adalight serial ambilight protocol!
- Full OTA software update capability (HTTP and ArduinoOTA)
